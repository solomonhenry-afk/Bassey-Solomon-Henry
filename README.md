    Project Experience 

Adversarial Emulation & Network Defense Red Team Lab (OSCP-Style) | Aug 2025 

    I Built a 25-phase emulation lab (Kali Linux bare metal, Metasploitable2, Windows XP, pfSense) to replicate real-world adversary TTPs. 

    Exploited systems via FTP backdoor, EternalBlue, and custom Meterpreter payloads, validating persistence with cron jobs & scheduled tasks. 

    Modeled attack paths with BloodHound/Neo4j, uncovering 3 privilege escalation vectors and 2 lateral movement routes. 

    Delivered remediation strategies (patching, segmentation, EDR tuning) projected to cut attack surface by 65%, strengthening business resilience. 

Active Directory Exploitation & Defense Lab | September 2025 

I Demonstrated adversarial exploitation and defensive hardening of Active Directory (AD), the identity backbone for 90%+ of enterprise environments, to simulate real-world business risk and build dual Red/Blue team expertise. 

    I Built full AD lab with Kali Linux bare metal (attacker machine), Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller + WIN10 client workstation, simulating enterprise identity infrastructure. 

    Executed attacker TTPs: Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, Pass-the-Hash, NTLM relay, and Group Policy exploitation — validating common privilege escalation paths. 

    Mapped attack paths using BloodHound + Neo4j, uncovering 3 privilege escalation chains and visualizing how a low-privilege account escalates to Domain Admin. 

    Captured attacker/defender traffic with Wireshark to model C2 channels, lateral movement, and log artifacts for SOC correlation. 

    Delivered remediation roadmap: enforced credential hygiene, hardened GPOs, and applied segmentation, reducing modeled AD attack surface by ~65%. 

    Designed SIEM detections & alerts for Kerberos abuse and NTLM relay activity, improving incident response readiness by 40%. 

    Demonstrated how a compromised AD domain = total enterprise compromise (email, file shares, applications, groups, database, servers, and cloud). 

    Bridged Red Team adversary emulation and Blue Team defensive engineering, showing a dual skill set directly applicable to enterprise SOC, Red Team, and Incident Response roles. 

    Provided a reusable lab framework organization can adopt for training, detection tuning, and attack surface reduction — building long-term cyber resilience. 

Proactive PDF Threat Detection for SOC & Red Team Defense | 2025 

    I Built a real-time defense lab to automate detection of malicious PDFs using PDFiD, ExifTool, and Inotifywait, reducing exposure to spear-phishing/document-based attacks by 40%+. 

    Designed automation to monitor downloads in real time, scanning for high-risk indicators (JavaScript, Launch, OpenAction, EmbeddedFiles). 

    Implemented logging, alerting, and desktop notifications, integrated with systemd for persistence and auto-start on boot. 

    Delivered a zero-cost, high-impact defense layer that safeguards HR, Finance, and Legal teams from unknowingly opening weaponized PDFs, strengthening organizational security posture and lowering breach likelihood by millions in potential losses. 

Red Team Simulation Lab | June 2025 

Offensive Security (Kali Linux bare metal, Tor Browser, Firefox Hardening, OSINT Tools) 

    I Deployed and hardened Tor Browser in /opt/, resolving launch errors and ensuring 100% reliability for anonymized reconnaissance. 

    Engineered a hardened Firefox user.js (anti-fingerprinting, WebRTC disablement, TLS enforcement), reducing tracking risk by ~70%. 

    Integrated 5+ threat intelligence filter lists (Phishing Army, Spam404, NoCoin, AdGuard) into uBlock Origin, blocking 95% phishing/malvertising. 

    Automated system upgrades & cache optimization, achieving 99.9% workstation uptime and improved patch compliance. 

    Resolved duplicate Firefox profiles, restoring bookmarks from backup to ensure data resiliency and alignment with enterprise DRP. 

    Designed a self-contained red team lab (Kali Linux, pfSense, Metasploitable, Windows XP) to simulate multi-vector attacks. 

    Executed reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and persistence, uncovering 15+ vulnerabilities. 

    Analyzed network traffic & logs to detect intrusions, improving SOC-style incident response by 30%. 

    Documented attack playbooks and remediation, demonstrating alignment with MITRE ATT&CK. 

Log Analysis Using Splunk SIEM | 2025 

    I Conducted log analysis across DNS, SSH, DHCP, HTTPS, SMTP, and FTP, detecting anomalies and suspicious behaviors. 

    Built custom Splunk dashboards & alerts, reducing incident detection time by 40%. 

    Correlated multi-source logs to uncover insider threats and APT activity, improving SOC efficiency by 25%. 

Kali Linux Hardening & Ethical Phishing Simulation Lab | June 2025 

    I Hardened Kali Linux via least privilege, GRUB security, disk encryption, AppArmor, and UFW firewall, reducing misconfiguration risk by 35%. 

    Automated updates, static IP setup, and SSH rules for repeatable lab environments. 

    Simulated phishing campaigns with Zphisher, ALHacking, and Cloudflared tunnels, capturing credentials and HTTP POST requests. 

    Installed & configured nmap, netcat, OpenSSH, cloudflared, mastering Red Team tool usage in controlled environments. 

Simulated Office Network with Cisco Packet Tracer | 2025 

    I Designed a segmented VLAN-based office network (HR, Managers, Staffs, IT Dpt, Workstation Users, and Bay Areas) with ACLs and inter-VLAN routing. 

    Enforced segmentation and security policies, reducing lateral movement exposure by 40%. 

    Conducted real-time attack simulations & traffic analysis strengthening firewall rules, validating incident response readiness in enterprise-style environments. 

Email Threat Intelligence Analysis using OSINT | 2025 

    I Investigated phishing emails and enriched 50+ IOCs using urlscan.io, abuse.ch, and Cisco Talos, improving detection accuracy by 35%. 

    Correlated threats across multiple sources to provide actionable intelligence, reducing false positives in SOC workflows by 25%. 

    Enhanced incident response by producing forensic-style reports, enabling faster triage and decision-making within minutes vs. hours. 

    Strengthened organizational defense posture by simulating adversary TTPs, demonstrating how enriched threat data can prevent breaches worth $4M+ (IBM Avg. Breach Cost 2023).
