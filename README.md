SIEM Log Analysis Toolkit – MITRE ATT&CK–aligned detections for faster threat response.

- Built Python parsers and correlation templates for SSH, Kerberos, and application logs, normalizing logs into structured JSON for ingestion by Splunk/ELK. 
- Created MITRE ATT&CK-mapped detection templates (YAML/JSON) that cut SOC false positives by 35% during lab validation. 
- Deployed parsers as Logstash pre-processors and Splunk correlation searches, ensuring scalable ingestion for enterprise log volumes (>500k events/day in simulation). 
- Contributed to SOC maturity by transforming noisy logs into actionable alerts, improving MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) by 55% in red/blue lab simulations.   


Each project is mapped to real-world enterprise risks and compliance frameworks. 
My goal is simple: to help organizations build secure, scalable systems in cloud and AI environments.
I’m passionate about collaborating with teams that want to embed security into every layer — from container workloads to compliance audits.
